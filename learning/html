Markup languages like HTML provide a set of predefined tags or elements that are used to wrap and define different parts of the content. These tags give meaning to the content and enable web browsers or other software to interpret and render it correctly. The tags define the structure and semantics of the content, allowing the browser to understand how to display it.
